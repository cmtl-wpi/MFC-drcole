# Thermocapillary migration of a 2D drop in the low-Marangoni limit, realized by BULK
# CONDUCTION -- Samareh, Mostaghimi & Moreau, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 73 (2014) 616-626,
# Sec. 4.1.1 / Fig. 5. This is the conduction companion to the frozen-T case_Ma_0.py. Both impose
# the temperature field through density (rho = rho_coeff/T at uniform p, recovered from the EOS),
# but here a finite thermal conductivity (small Marangoni number Ma) + isothermal gradient walls
# actively HOLD T near the imposed linear profile against the drop's own advection -- the frozen
# proxy decays once the drop starts to move, conduction restores it. As Ma -> 0 this approaches
# Samareh's invariant-T limit (v_t / v_YGB ~ 0.80). At Ma = 0.1 the two dt limits are comparable:
# the acoustic CFL governs at Nx = 64, and the explicit-conduction limit (dt ~ Ma*dx^2) takes over
# on finer grids.
#
# MFC is compressible, so a temperature gradient IS a density gradient: at uniform pressure the EOS
# gives T = (p+p_inf)/((gam-1)*rho*cv), so rho(y) = rho_coeff/T(y) encodes the imposed field. Both
# fluids are identical, so one analytic patch (shared smooth circle eta(x,y) driving color, the
# Laplace pressure jump, and density together) makes the recovered T exactly linear everywhere --
# drop included. T is shifted up by T0 = 10 (Samareh's T0 = 0) to keep rho positive; only gradT and
# sigma_T (which set v_YGB) are physical. Keep `e`-notation out of analytic strings: MFC's IC parser
# reads `e` as Euler's number.
